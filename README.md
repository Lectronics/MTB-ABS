# MTB-ABS
A functional DIY ABS unit for mountain bikes accessible to the general public
It is designed to run on an Arduino and take solenoids from a car's ABS system

1) I don't know what I am doing.
2) Finding an ABS modulator from a car is proving more difficult than expected.
3) The goal with the software is to keep whatever is in the main loop as short as possible or even
keep all of the code in the function that is written for the interrupt routine.
4) My idea for the wheel speed sensor is to use a rotary encoder instead of an ABS ring to make the system more of a bolt-on system.
